    <p>Super Mario Odyssey[a] is a platform game published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch on October 27, 2017. An entry in the Super Mario series, it follows Mario and Cappy, a sentient hat that allows Mario to control other characters and objects, as they journey across various worlds to save Princess Peach from his nemesis Bowser, who plans to forcibly marry her. In contrast to the linear gameplay of prior entries, the game returns to the primarily open-ended, exploration-based gameplay featured in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine.</p>

<p>The game was developed by Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development division, and began development following the release of Super Mario 3D World in 2013. Various ideas were suggested during development, and to incorporate them all, the team decided to employ a sandbox-style of gameplay. Unlike previous installments such as New Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario 3D World, which were aimed at a casual audience, the team designed Super Mario Odyssey to appeal to the series' core fans. The game also features a vocal theme song, "Jump Up, Super Star!", a first for the series.</p>

<p>Super Mario Odyssey received universal acclaim and has sold 14.44 million copies since release, making it the Switch's second bestselling game. Many critics called it one of the best games in the series, with particular praise directed toward its inventiveness and originality. It also won numerous awards and accolades, including for game of the year.</p><br>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Super Mario Odyssey is a platform game in which players control Mario as he travels across many different worlds, known as "Kingdoms", on the Odyssey, a hat-shaped ship, to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser, who plans to forcibly marry her. The Kingdoms in the game return to the exploration-based level design featured in Super Mario 64. Each Kingdom has Mario searching for and clearing various objectives in order to obtain items known as Power Moons, which can power up the Odyssey and grant access to new Kingdoms. Checkpoint flags littered throughout each Kingdom allow Mario to instantly warp to them once activated. Certain levels feature areas called "flat" zones, where Mario is placed in a 2D side-scrolling environment similar to his appearance in the original Super Mario Bros.<br><br>

In addition to his existing moves, like triple-jumping and wall-jumping, Mario can throw his cap, the physical form of a hat spirit named Cappy, in multiple directions to attack enemies and use as a temporary platform. When the cap is thrown at certain objects, enemies, or non-playable characters, Mario is able to take possession of them, referred to as "capturing", allowing him to use unique abilities. For example, Mario can possess a Bullet Bill to fly across large gaps, a bolt of electricity called a Spark Pylon to climb up electric wires, and a tank called a Sherm to fire at enemies and break blocks for passage. Some actions can be accelerated by using motion controls in the Joy-Con controllers, but the game is otherwise fully playable when the Joy-Con are attached to the Switch console. Throughout the game, Mario can pick up coins, including purple ones unique to each kingdom, to spend on items such as new hats and outfits, some of which are required for completing certain objectives. The game uses a health system similar to the Super Mario Galaxy games, although Mario has unlimited lives; the only penalty for dying is paying up to ten coins. The player can also collect items known as 'Life-Up Hearts' which grant three extra hit points. The game also features cooperative play, in which a second player takes control of Cappy and can attack enemies independently of Mario.<br><br>

The game requires a minimum number of Power Moons to be collected from each Kingdom to move onto the next, though these may be obtained from any source, making major objectives largely optional. Once Bowser is defeated, each kingdom is repopulated with more Power Moons. Collecting enough Power Moons allows for additional outfits to be purchased and unlocks two bonus areas. One of these areas is a boss rush called Dark Side, with 250 Power Moons required to enter. The other is a level called Darker Side that combines many elements of the game, and requires 500 Power Moons to enter. In addition to this, there is also a level based on Peach's Castle from Super Mario 64 unlocked by beating the game. This level allows Mario to face harder versions of previously-defeated bosses and earn additional Power Moons by completing in-game achievements.<br><br>

The game features a photo mode that allows players to use a free-moving camera to take and save screenshots, with additional options such as filters and stickers. Use of the Odyssey-themed Mario, Peach, and Bowser Amiibo figurines allow for special in-game abilities and unlocking special costumes which are otherwise unavailable until after the player completes the game and collects enough Power Moons. Other Amiibo can be scanned to provide hints to finding Power Moons.<br><br>

A hide-and-seek minigame called "Luigi's Balloon World" was released on February 21, 2018 as part of an update. In it, players have 30 seconds to hide a balloon somewhere in a kingdom, which is then able to be played by others attempting to find it. A leaderboard system ranks the players who have found the most balloons.<br><br></p>
<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>Bowser, with the aid of the Broodals, a family of anthropomorphic rabbits serving as his wedding planners, kidnaps Princess Peach from the Mushroom Kingdom and takes her aboard his airship, intent on forcibly marrying her. Mario attempts to rescue her but is thrown off the ship by Bowser's top hat and falls into the neighboring Cap Kingdom. With Mario gone, Bowser stomps on Mario's cap and begins his wedding to marry Peach. Bowser leaves Mario's cap to drift into the ship's rear propellers, shredding it to pieces. A piece of the hat is grabbed by Cappy. Mario meets Cappy, one of the Cap Kingdom's sentient hat-like creatures, and learns that Bowser also kidnapped Cappy's sister Tiara to be used as Peach's wedding tiara. Cappy joins Mario and takes the shape of Mario's cap, providing him with the ability to temporarily capture other creatures and objects. They travel to the nearby Cascade Kingdom and recover an airship, the Odyssey, and begin pursuing Bowser.<br><br>

Mario and Cappy explore the various kingdoms to collect Power Moons to fuel the Odyssey and battle the Broodals, who steal artifacts from several kingdoms to set up Bowser's wedding. Eventually, they catch up to Bowser in his own kingdom and defeat the Broodals. However, Bowser departs for his wedding on the Moon. Mario and Cappy fly the Odyssey to the Moon's surface and confront Bowser inside a cathedral. Mario and Bowser battle in an underground cavern. Mario wins the battle and frees Peach and Tiara, but the cavern begins to collapse. Mario captures an unconscious Bowser and escapes to the surface with Peach and Tiara. After Peach thanks Mario for his help, Bowser regains consciousness and decides to properly propose to Peach, causing Mario to do the same in haste. Overwhelmed, Peach ends up rejecting both of them. Peach, Cappy and Tiara board the Odyssey. Mario and Bowser get upset before Peach tells Mario that it's time to go home. Mario boards the ship just in time, leaving Bowser stranded on the Moon.<br><br></p>

    <h4 class="title-lyrics">Here we go, off the rails<br>
        Don't you know it's time 
        to raise our sails<br>
        It's freedom like you never knew<br><br>
        Don't need bags, or a pass<br>
        Say the word i'll be there in a flash<br>
        You can say my hat is of to you<br><br>
        Oh we can zoom<br>
        All the way to the moon<br>
        From this great wide wacky world<br>
        Jump with me, grab coins with me<br>
        Oh yeah<br><br>
        It's time to jump up in the air (Jump up in the air)<br>
        Jump up, don't be scared (Jump up, don't be scared)<br>
        Jump up and your cares will soar away<br>
        And if the dark clouds start to swirl(Dark clouds start to         swirl)<br>
        Don't fear, don't shed a tear 'cause<br>
        I'll be your 1UP girl.<br><br>
        So lets all jump up super high (Jump up super high)<br>
        High up in the sky (High up in the sky)<br>

        No one else can take me this far<br>
        I'm flippin' the switch<br>

        Odyssey, odyssey<br>

       Spin the wheel, take a chance<br>
       Every journey starts a new romance<br>
       A new world's calling out to you<br>
       Take a turn, off the path<br>
       Find a new addition to the cast<br>
       You know that any captain needs a crew<br><br>
       Take it in stride as you move, side to side<br>
They're just different points of view<br>
Jump with me, grab coins with me<br>
Oh yeah!<br><br>

Come on and jump up in the air (Jump up in the air)<br>
Jump without a care (Jump without a care)<br>
Jump up 'cause you know that I'll be there<br>
And if you find you're short on joy (Find you're short on joy)<br>
Don't fret, just don't forget that<br>
You're still our 1UP Boy<br><br>

So go on, straighten up your cap (Straighten up your cap)<br>
Let your toes begin to tap (Toes begin to tap)<br>
This rhythm is a power 'shroom<br>
Don't forget you're the superstar (You're the superstar)<br>
No one else can make it this far<br>
Put a comb through that 'stache<br>
Now you've got panache<br>
Oh, let's do the odyssey!<br><br>

It's time to jump up in the air (Jump up in the air)<br>
Jump up, don't be scared (Jump up don't be scared)<br>
Jump up and your cares will soar away (oohoohooh)<br>
And if the dark clouds start to swirl (Dark clouds start to swirl)<br>
Don't fear, don't shed a tear, 'cause<br>
I'll be your 1UP Girl<br><br>

Now listen all you boys and girls (All you boys and girls)<br>
All around the world (All around the world)<br>
Don't be afraid to get up and move<br>
You know that we're all superstars (We're all superstars)<br>
We're the ones who've made it this far<br>
Put a smile on that face<br>
There's no time to waste<br>
Oh, let's do the odyssey!<br><br>
